# mini_project
A fully responsive multi-page portfolio website built using HTML and CSS, showcasing modern layout techniques, responsiveness, and a complete GitHub workflow.
📌 Project Description

This project is a Responsive Portfolio Website developed using pure HTML5 and CSS3 as part of a frontend mini project.
The main objective of this project is to apply all core concepts of HTML structure, CSS layout techniques, responsiveness, and basic UI enhancement in a real-world website.

The website is designed as a multi-page application, consisting of four separate pages:
Home (index.html), About, Projects, and Contact.
All pages are interconnected using a common navigation bar, ensuring smooth and consistent navigation throughout the website.

A single external CSS file is used across all pages to maintain uniform styling, color themes, and layout consistency.
Modern CSS concepts such as Flexbox (for navigation and card layouts), CSS Grid (for image gallery and project sections), Positioning (sticky navbar), Media Queries (for mobile, tablet, and desktop views), and CSS animations and hover effects are implemented to enhance the user experience.

The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts automatically to different screen sizes without breaking the layout.
Special attention has been given to clean folder structure, semantic HTML tags, and scalable design practices, making the project easy to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

In addition to frontend development, this project also emphasizes the complete GitHub workflow, including repository creation, meaningful commits, feature-based branching, pull requests, and deployment using GitHub Pages.
This helped simulate a real-world collaborative development environment.
